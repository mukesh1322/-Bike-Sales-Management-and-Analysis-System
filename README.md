# Bike Sales Management and Analysis System
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of bike sales transactions, while providing insightful data for inventory management and sales analysis. The Bike Sales Management System is a Python-based solution designed to automate and streamline the sales processes of bike dealerships. The system improves operational effectiveness, enhances customer satisfaction, and offers useful information to aid in business decision-making.

The project uses web and Python technologies to build a comprehensive and user-friendly interface, allowing employees to manage bike sales efficiently. By automating key tasks, this system boosts productivity, improves customer service, and provides valuable insights for business growth.

Features
User-friendly Interface: Employees can select bikes, add them to a customerâ€™s cart, and calculate the final cost.
Invoice Generation: Automatically creates invoices with a detailed list of purchased bikes, tax information, and the total cost.
Transaction Management: Allows employees to mark transactions as complete.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data, ensuring high-quality data analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes sales distributions, price points, and customer demographics through histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.
Sales Analysis: Identifies relationships between bike characteristics and sales performance, including price elasticity and the impact of different factors on sales volume.
Competitive Pricing Analysis: Helps optimize pricing strategies to maximize profitability while maintaining competitive market positioning.
Customer Retention Analysis: Tracks retention rates and identifies key factors influencing customer churn, supporting the development of personalized loyalty programs and targeted offers.
